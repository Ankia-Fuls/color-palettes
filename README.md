# How to use

Simply click on the color you would like to use to copy the hex code to your clipboard.

If you would like to test how colors work together, paste the hex codes in the top input fields and click the button to change the text on the sides to use these colors. For now the colors are only used for the text color, background color, and decoration colors for the border and underline. If a field is left empty, a default color is used, so you do not have to complete all the fields for it to work.
